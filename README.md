# calculator

Calculator project to practice usage of HTML, CSS and plain Javascript to create a fully functional calculator.

The main goal of the project is nothing but sheer practice of everything I've learned the past few months on my journey to learning full stack web development. Special attention will be put towards keeping code as readable as possible. I will also avoid using functions like eval() or the Function constructor because of a) potential security risks (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#Never_use_eval!) and b) to go through the process of learning to build functions to evaluate calculations manually.
